## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** – For data modeling, visualization, and geospatial mapping
- **Microsoft Excel** – For cleaning and preprocessing the data
- **Maps & Charts** – Custom visuals including:
  - Clustered bar charts
  - Geographical map bubbles
  - Filterable slicers by month and district

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Bhopal, Indore, and Gwalior** consistently show higher OPD/IPD counts.
- **Immunization coverage** varies significantly across districts.
- Monthly comparison shows fluctuation in patient counts and healthcare service delivery.
